This is the uploader node app for the image resizer here: http://dev.gregoryprill.com/resize/

The purpose is to explore a way to accept an image upload and then display it at any given size with that image actually being exactly that size. To acheive this we use an uploader node app and a resizer node app in addition to the angular2 app on the front end.

Works with my image-resizer-angular2 and node-resize repos.
